# usage:      It takes two or three args.  
#             1: the file spec you want to search in like *.html or *.css. 
#             2: the string you want to grep in the files found using the search spec.
#                Try "calc" to find files that may relate to the calculator.
#             3: the starting directory from which you want to start your search.
#                If you don't provide one, it uses '/edx/app/edxapp/edx-platform/lms'
#
# warning:  Surround your first argument with quotes.
#           Surround your second argument with quotes if it contains any spaces.
